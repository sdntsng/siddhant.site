<strong>Our goal with Flipkart Ads Academy</strong>

In today's fast-paced and ever-changing business landscape, keeping up with the latest trends, techniques, and technologies is crucial to success. This is especially true for B2B businesses, where knowledge and skills are often the driving force behind growth and innovation.<br /><br />The goal was to provide advertisers with a comprehensive learning experience that would equip them with the skills and knowledge needed to succeed in the fast-paced world of e-commerce. The overall structure and roadmap were planned in close collaboration with partner agencies and internal teams to ensure a smooth launch.

The platform and website were designed to provide a user-friendly experience that was both visually appealing and easy to navigate. I also got a chance to get my hands dirty with a little bit of coding, something <a href="http://siddhant.site/blog">I love doing</a> outside of my job anyway. The content was specifically curated for our target audience of brands and agencies, including a range of courses and resources on topics such as campaign management, ad creative, and data analysis.<br /><br /><strong>Exclusive yet accessible</strong>

The Search Ads Certification, Flipkart Ads Academy's primary certification exam, was designed to be challenging yet achievable, with a pass rate of only 50%, which set a high bar for industry standards. The high completion rates prove its value and relevance.

After launching the Academy, the focus shifted towards driving engagement and adoption of the platform. A LinkedIn shareable certification program and a campus engagement program were introduced that led to a campus drive for the Ads Academy across 400+ business schools. These initiatives helped to increase awareness of the Academy and attract a large number of sign-ups from advertisers.

The numbers speak for themselves. To date, there have been over 7k certified advertisers on the Academy. The completion rate of 47% is notably higher than the MOOC industry standard rates of 2% to 14%, <a href="https://www.skilljar.com/customer-education-benchmarks-and-trends-report/">according to Skilljar.</a>

We've also made great strides in delivering earned media posts and certification links on LinkedIn, proving the user love for the academy and exemplifying its relevance. Super proud of the hard work and dedication that went into building this innovative platform. Excited to see the impact it's having on advertisers and looking continue improving and growing!
