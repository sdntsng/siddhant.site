<p>As the end of the year approaches, I find myself eagerly anticipating my trip to Seoul this December. After a long month of tough days at work, I am more than ready for a, as they say at work, "well-deserved" vacation. This will be the second trip abroad this year for Rhea &amp; I, after visiting the beautiful Maldives earlier in February. We can't wait to relax and explore the vibrant city.</p>

<p>Seoul is a vibrant and exciting city, and there are so many things we are looking forward to experiencing in our two week long trip. For one, we are both avid hikers (or I'd like to believe so. She's actually a beach person). I am excited to explore the many hiking trails &amp; beautiful mountains that surround Seoul. </p>

<p>We also love trying new foods, and can't wait to taste all of the delicious Korean cuisine that Seoul has to offer. The city has a thriving food scene, with everything from traditional Korean dishes to fusion cuisine. It has been over a year since we made kimchi &amp; bibimbap our staple in Bangalore whenever she visits, so hopefully, we'll be able to do justice to that with a mix of known and unknown delicacies. I can't wait to try some of the local specialties, and maybe even venture out to try some more exotic options. Hopefully, we will also be able to squeeze in some sightseeing of the breathtaking views of the city while getting some warm sauna time during the freezing season that we're visiting in.<br><br>In addition to these more traditional activities, we are also planning to experience some of the city's more off-beat attractions. We are planning to visit the Trick Eye Museum, where we can take some truly unique photos by interacting with the museum's optical illusions. Of course, no trip to Seoul would be complete without experiencing the city's nightlife. We plan on checking out some of the trendiest bars and clubs, and maybe even trying out some traditional Korean entertainment like karaoke</p>

<p>Overall, I am looking forward to a fun and exciting trip to Seoul. We are both eager to explore the city and try new things, and I can't wait to see what the city has in store for us. This vacation is sure to be the perfect way to end a tough year on a high note.</p>
