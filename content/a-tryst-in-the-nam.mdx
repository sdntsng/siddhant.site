<p><a href="https://www.siddhant.site/blog/up-next-seoulful-days/">Our trip to Seoul</a> didn't go exactly as planned... Just a few days before we were set to depart, our flights were unexpectedly changed by the airline, Vietjet. The lead up to the travel days was stressful. As a result, our trip to South Korea had to be cut short by 3 days, and we ended up making an impromptu trip to Vietnam instead.</p>

<p>Despite the changes, we still managed to make the most of our time in Seoul. We were able to explore all of the city's highlights, from hiking in the mountains to tasting all of the delicious Korean cuisine. We even got to attend a K-Pop concert, just as we had planned. </p>

<p>One of our favorite meals was at a small restaurant that served traditional Korean barbecue. We sat at a tabletop grill and cooked our own meats and vegetables to perfection. The flavors were out of this world, and we left the restaurant feeling satisfied and full.We also made sure to try some of the city's street food, which included everything from spicy stir-fried squid to sweet and savory dumplings. No matter where we ate, the food in Seoul was always fresh, flavorful, and satisfying.</p>

<p>On the 23rd of December, we found ourselves on a flight to Da Nang, Vietnam. Although we were disappointed to have to leave Seoul earlier than expected, we were excited to explore a new place, Hoi An. </p>

<p>Hoi An was a beautiful and charming city, and we were able to spend the rest of our trip exploring its beaches, markets, and ancient temples. We even got to try some authentic Vietnamese cuisine, which was a highlight for both of us. Sometimes the unexpected changes can lead to new and exciting adventures, and we can't wait to see what the future holds for us.<br><br>One of the things we loved most about Hoi An was the food (am I repeating this too often?). The city is known for its seafood, and we were able to try all sorts of delicious dishes like grilled squid, spicy shrimp, and crispy fried fish. We also loved trying the local specialties, like banh mi (a type of sandwich made with grilled meat and vegetables) and cao lau (a noodle dish made with pork and greens).</p>

<p>Overall, our trip to Seoul and Vietnam was an unforgettable experience. Despite the unexpected changes to our original plans, we were able to make the most of our time and create lasting memories. We can't wait to plan our next adventure and see what the world has in store for us.</p>
