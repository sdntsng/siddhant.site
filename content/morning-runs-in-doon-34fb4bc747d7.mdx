The encompassing hills of Doon are clad in pines, oaks, and deodars. They aren’t scenic alone, but also soul-stirring. One runs across them, following a trail- known or unknown- just to reach a place that is pacifying enough to calm you down after a run. Bonus- the said place is a stream, so you can listen to the water as well. The sound of water trickling down the mountainous terrain is captivating. On umpteen occasions, I’ve just sat there for minutes that turned into hours, contemplating my life, solving dilemmas, or listening to the music that the stone-beating trickles create.

Once the foothill has been chosen, you run. Aim for the foothill and run. Forget everything that you should, think of what you want to, listen to chill-step or soft acoustic- whatever suits you, and run. As crazy as this may sound, for it is indeed a run-like-a-bull jog, you won’t be disappointed. You can always choose your pace. As I said- whatever suits you as long as you reach the end.

The returns are easier because you feel good about yourself on the way back. I usually come back once I see the sun over the mountain top. On my way back, I admire the clarity that a morning jog can give me. It is almost inexpressible, the superb impact that the runs have had on me, both physically and mentally. Earlier the runs used to be an escape from life for me. Now they are a source of energy to live that life. Regardless of what the purpose is, the runs have always achieved their purpose. The morning runs, here in Doon, are unmatchable.
