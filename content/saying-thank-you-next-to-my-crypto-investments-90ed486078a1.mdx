<p id="b951" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">Like any tech enthusiast who has ever been a part of <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://ideas.ted.com/an-eye-opening-look-at-the-dot-com-bubble-of-2000-and-how-it-shapes-our-lives-today/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-href="https://ideas.ted.com/an-eye-opening-look-at-the-dot-com-bubble-of-2000-and-how-it-shapes-our-lives-today/">a bubble</a>, I feel like I may have waited too long for this. But now, I think, the time has finally come. I’m selling off my leftover crypto-assets and moving on with life. Taking this opportunity to pen-down a few (mis-?) adventures over the past 5 years! <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">This is part 1</strong> of what is probably going to be a series of posts, so bear with me.</p>
<h3 id="e152" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">How it started</h3>
<p id="787c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">No, I didn’t get excited about mining when my cousin told me about it in 2013. I wasn’t even slightly moved when a friend of a friend made his riches in <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/kitconews/2013/12/10/2013-year-of-the-bitcoin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/kitconews/2013/12/10/2013-year-of-the-bitcoin/">the first boom.</a> I became invested in the cryptocurrencies in the most unfashionable way one can imagine.</p>
<p id="fdfc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">So the story goes this way — I was on a major freelancing spree late in 2014. Graphic Design, Social Media Content, SEO Content, Mockups, Branding Kits, Banners, Flyers, Business Websites, Landing Pages — you name it, I was making it. Que <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://www.reddit.com/user/kidfraser" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-href="https://www.reddit.com/user/kidfraser">/u/kidfraser,</a> a U.S. based freelancer who needed some help with logo designs. I found him on a subreddit, as you can tell from his reference. I wasn’t too sure if he was flipping his work, or if he was genuinely overbooked, but the gig seemed pretty much what I wanted to do. Work was discussed in detail with minor references to the range of budget.</p>

<p>And finally, when we came to discuss payments — he hit the home run (Fine. A sixer for me, home run for him).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Are you cool with BTC?”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Am I cool with BTC? Of course, I’m cool with BTC. I have no clue what it is, or how it works or how we’re going to transact. But you, sir, are bringing me work when I want it. BTC could very well be Barely True Currency. But barely works for me. As long as I can let it into my PayPal account, it’s cool. So yes, I’m cool with, um, BTC.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I say yes, then proceed to Google how this works and what I’m up for. It appears I need a wallet. Blockchain.info looks like the government of this thing, hm. Governments are the least risky (This is a pre-Venezuelan crisis scenario, mind you). I’ll go with <a href="http://blockchain.info/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Blockchain.info</a> for my wallet.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At this point, I’m not even clear how conversions would translate, so I take a shot in the dark. “0.3 BTC per assignment”, I say (That’s about $75 at the time and $5000 in December 2017). The guy negotiates a bit and finally settles for 0.1 BTC. I’m okay with that.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And that’s all! I have just invested in what’s going to be a revolutionary currency, a failure, a point of speculation for governments, a fad — all at the same time.</p>
