<p>Red Cable Pro was created as a tiered membership program, offering premium partner benefits including Uber Executive, Spotify Premium, and Amazon Prime. Users could subscribe to Red Cable Pro through direct purchases on the OnePlus Store app/Phone Settings/OnePlus Community app, or through code redemptions issued either through third-party platforms or operational campaigns.</p>
