Plunk provides built-in tracking for email opens and link clicks. This allows you to monitor the engagement of your emails and gain insights into how your contacts interact with your content.

## Open tracking

When open tracking is enabled, Plunk includes a small, invisible tracking pixel in your emails. When a contact opens the email, the pixel is loaded, and Plunk records the open event.

### Considerations
- Open tracking relies on the loading of images in the email client. If a contact has images disabled, the open event may not be recorded.
- Some email clients may pre-load images, which can result in false open events.

## Click tracking

Click tracking is enabled by default for all emails sent through Plunk. When a contact clicks on a link in the email, Plunk records the click event and tracks which link was clicked.

### Considerations
- Click tracking works by rewriting the URLs in your email to point to Plunk's tracking servers
- Some email clients or security software may block tracking links, which can result in missed click events

## Configuration
There are three levels of configuration for tracking:

| Level | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Enabled | Tracking is enabled for all emails |
| Disabled | Tracking is disabled for all emails |
| Marketing only | Tracking is enabled only for marketing emails (templates and campaigns) |
