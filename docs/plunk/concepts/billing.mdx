Plunk's pricing is based on the number of emails sent each month. You can send both marketing and transactional emails under the same plan.

## Free Tier
Free tier projects can send up to 1,000 emails per month at no cost. Projects on this tier will include a Plunk-branded footer in all emails.

## Pay-as-you-go
After upgrading from the free tier, you will be charged per email sent at $0.001 per email. There are no monthly fees or commitments, you only pay for what you use.

You are able to monitor your email usage and set billing limits per category in the billing tab of the project settings.

## Special considerations
- Emails that contain an attachment will incur double the cost (e.g. 1 email with attachment = 2 emails for billing purposes)
