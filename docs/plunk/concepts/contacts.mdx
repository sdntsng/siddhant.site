Contacts in Plunk represent an individual email recipient. Each contact has an identifier and is linked to an email address.

## Adding contacts
Contacts can be added to your Plunk project in several ways:
- Using [/v1/track](/api-reference/public-api/trackEvent), when tracking an event for a contact that does not yet exist, Plunk will automatically create it.
- Using [/contacts](/api-reference/contacts/createContact), to create a single contact.
- Import through CSV
- Manually through the dashboard

## Contact Data
You can associate custom data with each contact using key-value pairs. This data can be used for segmentation and personalization.

### Data types
Contact data types are inferred based on the value provided:
| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| String | Any text value |
| Number | Numeric values, including integers and floats |
| Boolean | True or false values |
| Date | Date values in ISO 8601 format |

If you accidentally mix data types for a specific key, Plunk will default to treating the value as a string.

### Reserved keys
Certain keys are reserved by the system and automatically set by Plunk:
| Key | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| email | The contact's email address |
| createdAt | Timestamp of when the contact was created |
| updatedAt | Timestamp of the last update to the contact |
| subscribed | Boolean indicating if the contact is globally subscribed or not |

### Special keys
| Key | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| locale | The contact's preferred locale in ISO 639 (e.g. 'en', 'fr', 'es'). Specifying the locale field on a contact will override the project-wide locale for contact-facing pages and email footers |
