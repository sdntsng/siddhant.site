Transactional emails are emails sent directly through the API. They are typically used for one-to-one communication, such as password resets, order confirmations, and notifications.

## Sending with attachments
Plunk supports sending attachments with transactional emails. You can include up to 10 attachments per email, with a maximum total size of 10MB. Attachments should be base64 encoded and included in the `attachments` array when sending the email via the [/v1/email/send](/api-reference/public-api/sendEmail) endpoint.

## Sending from a template
You can also send transactional emails using a [template](/concepts/templates) you have created in the dashboard. This allows you to reuse the same design and content for multiple emails, while still personalizing them with contact data.
