Campaigns are a one-time email sent to a group of contacts. They are typically used for newsletters, announcements, or promotions.

## Targeting contacts
When you create a campaign, you can send it to all subscribed contacts, or target a specific segment you have created in the [Segments](/concepts/segments) section.

## Sending a campaign
Once you have designed your campaign and selected the target audience, you can schedule it to be sent immediately or at a later time. You can also choose to send a test email to yourself or any other team member before sending it to your contacts.

Campaigns will be queued and sent in the background. You can monitor the sending progress and view detailed analytics on opens, clicks, and bounces in the campaign detail page. Depending on the size of your audience, it may take some time for all emails to be sent.
